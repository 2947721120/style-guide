      <marked-element><script type="text/markdown">
        <p class="tldr">Provide a thorough overview of what the element does, and provide examples of common usage patterns. Format the documentation as markdown.</p>

        If the element declares a `<dom-module>`, write the documentation via HTML comments preceeding that `<dom-module>`:

            <!--
            `<awesome-sauce>` injects a healthy dose of awesome into your page.

            In typical use, just slap some `<awesome-sauce>` at the top of your body:

                <body>
                  <awesome-sauce></awesome-sauce>

            Wham! It's all awesome now!
            -->
            <dom-module id="awesome-sauce">

        If your element lacks a `<dom-module>`, write documentation via a JSDoc comment attached to its `Polymer()` call:

            /**
             * `<awesome-sauce>` injects a healthy dose of awesome into your page.
             *
             * In typical use, just slap some `<awesome-sauce>` at the top of your body:
             *
             *     <body>
             *       <awesome-sauce></awesome-sauce>
             *
             * Wham! It's all awesome now!
             */

      <marked-element><script type="text/markdown">
        <p class="tldr">Document all public properties. Docs should start with a one line summary. Make sure that the property's type is annotated.</p>

        For example, the most simple property documentation can be a single line:

            /** Whether this element is currently awesome. */
            isAwesome: Boolean,

        If the property doesn't specifiy a type, or that type is not primitive, be sure to [annotate](#type-annotation) the type properly:

            /**
             * Metadata describing what has been made awesome on the page.
             *
             * @type {{elements: Array<HTMLElement>, level: number}}

      <marked-element><script type="text/markdown">
        <p class="tldr">Follow the [property guidelines](#properties). Additionally, make sure the types for all params and return values are documented.</p>

        For example:

            /**
             * Applies awesomeness to `element`.
             *
             * @param {HTMLElement} element The element to be made awesome.
             * @param {number} level The numeric level of awesomeness. A value
             *     between `1` and `11`.
             * @param {Array<HTMLElements>=} refs Optional referenced elements
             *     that become awesome by proxy.
             * @return {number} The cumulative level of awesomeness.
             */

      <marked-element><script type="text/markdown">
        <p class="tldr">When in doubt, keep to the 3rd person present tense and keep it simple.</p>

        A few guidelines for consistency:

        *   Use the 3rd person for descriptions. 
          
            - Good. "Creates a foo."
            - Avoid. "Create a foo."

            Use 2nd person ("Do this...") when you're _trying_ to be prescriptive,
            such as, "**Add** the `toolbar` attribute to the element you want
            to use as a toolbar."

        *   Use the present tense whenever possible.

            - Good. "Clicking the element starts an animation."
            - Avoid. "Clicking the element will start an animation."

        *   Start method descriptions with an active verb. 

            - Good. "Starts the animation."
            - Avoid. "This method to starts the animation."

        *   It's OK to use a fragment, especially in a short description.

            - Good. "Item height, in pixels."
            - Avoid. "This property specifies the item height, in pixels."

            (Fragments should still start with a capital letter and 
            have ending punctuation.)

        The [JavaDoc Style Guide](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html#styleguide) 
        is a good resource on general API doc style. Most of the style rules
        described there can be applied here as well.
